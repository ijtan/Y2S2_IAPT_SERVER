\subsection{The Server}
An api server was written in python, as due to the small scale of the application, this was ideal to meet the requirements whilst keeping the 
implementation simple enough. The server provides several endpoints which may be pinged, but only two particular endpoints are used. 
\subsubsection{Location Updates}
The server keeps track of a list of active devices, (though a unique identifier provided on requests), and their last known location.
The device regularly updates the sever wit lcoation infromation, and then requests nearby landmark data. 
The server loops through all landmarks, and calculates the distance between the device longitude and latitude positioning, and the landmark.
If the distance is below some threshold, it is added to a list of potnetially explorable landmarks, which is returned as a JSON response 
to the device. Each landmark entry also contains a geofence region, which when is larger than the distance, the landmarks is considered near 
the user, and the device can knmow that the AR mode can be enabled.
