\subsection{Location Data \&  Augmented Reality}
In modern smartphones the GPS system is fast and accurate, especially for purposes of landmark geofencing, 
as utmost accuracy is not a requirement. The advancment in smartphone technologies also enable richer AR experiences, as higher quality 
experiences may be included with less concern with device processing power.\\
When these two technologies are combined, the epxerience is taken to another level, as the Augmented Reality experience can shift based on 
the device's real conditiorns and positioning. A level of immersion is reached, as users need to actually move and visit ehritage sites in 
order to experience the Augmented Reality effects, and in return they gain context and heritage information about the landmarks visited.   
\subsection{Google ARCore \& Unity Technologies}
Google ARCore is a huge leap in the process of mainstreaming Augmented Reality experiences. The ARCore frameworks makes it much simpler 
to implement the intended AR experience, without the need of reinventing everything from scratch. This enables lower-cost projects, lower 
qaulified developers and faster integration to AR projects, providing a gateway to the mainstream acceptance of AR.
