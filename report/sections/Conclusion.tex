From the results obtained, through the combination of different technologies, AR provides deep potential when applied to tourism, 
whilst the libraries allow for easier and a more mainstream adaption of the technologies. The effects of location and compass sensory data have 
also been observed to enhance the AR experience even further. Finally, the centralised nature of the server proves for greater expandability and allows 
for data to be changed and reflected in the application in real-time.\\

Overall, I managed to meet the intended aims and objectives, and during the process also 
obtained hands-on experience of using the latest technologies to apply the theories learnt into 
practice. Augmented Reality and computer vision as a domain also turned out to be extremely rewarding, as the effort done is immediately reflected in tangible progress.
