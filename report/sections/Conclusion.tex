In this project, I managed to meet the intended aims and objectives and during the process also 
obtained hands-on experience of using the latest technologies to apply the theories learnt into 
practice. 
Augmented Reality and computer vision as a domain also turned out to be very rewarding, 
as the effort done is immediately reflected into tangible progress.  

\subsection{Future Work}
During development, it was made sure to keep the system as open as possible. Through the 
centralised API, unity engine and other technologies used, the system is meant to be dynamic and 
expandable.\\
With minimal effort, it can be easily be adapted to different uses such as an AR game, 
using google APIs for international standardized locations or even showing 3D models in AR mode.
